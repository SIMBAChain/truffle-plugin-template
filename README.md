# truffle-plugin-template
This repo is a template/boilerplate for a project that uses the SIMBA truffle plugin

User would overwrite this README with their own user instructions, but 

Note that some directories/files that are listed in .gitignore are present in this project structure. That is just so users have a full understanding of the relevant project structure, and can use this boilerplate. A user should ALWAYS make sure that **authconfig.json and **.env are present in their .gitignore file, since these are files that will contain secrets.
